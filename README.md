# Sentiment Analysis Using TensorFlow

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that classifies financial text into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It was built using TensorFlow and Keras as part of a personal learning project to explore deep learning for financial applications.
